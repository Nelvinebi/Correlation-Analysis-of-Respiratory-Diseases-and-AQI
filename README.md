📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the statistical relationship between Air Quality Index (AQI) and respiratory disease incidence rates using synthetic data. It demonstrates data generation, cleaning, visualization, and correlation computation (Pearson method) to explore environmental health impacts.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains over 100 synthetic records, including:

Date

AQI

Respiratory_Disease_Cases

Data is stored in an Excel file for analysis and visualization.

📊 Example Plots
AQI vs Respiratory Disease Cases

Correlation Heatmap

🚀 Usage
